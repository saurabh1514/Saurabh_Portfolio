                    To be honest, I started my web development journey after I completed my graduation.In today's time
                    this sounds little weird.Everytime I come across people who are junior to me they say , I want to
                    become a web developer.
                    perhaps developer these days are having a great time. Demand for good developers is sky rocketing
                    and hence their pay as well is sky rocketing.
                    So came to my journey or should I say , How I develop interest in web development coming from
                    Electronics and Telecommunication background.
                    I did not web development until final year of my enginnering ( I have just known about HTML, CSS etc
                    is used to build websites or apps , no implementation).After completion of my final year I have
                    decided to give a chance to learn web development.
                    I did a course on fundamentals of web development and in that course period I find that I am
                    enjoying this learning phase and I have develop interest as well.
                    After completion of course,I have applied for internship for the same role and I got the
                    internship.During the internship, I learn and develop small components and it was that moment that I
                    really started enjoying.
                    Sometimes we get overwhelmed about learning so much about web development but give yourself a time ,
                    understand the basics , fundamentals and Practice Practice Practice. Over the time you will develop
                    confidance and you will grow everyday and also learn everyday.
